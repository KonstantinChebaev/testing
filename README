There are three programs wich written to get started an internship.

1. Console Calculator

General description
It is a calculator for evaluating arithmetic expressions.

An expression can consist of:

Digits (0-9)
Dots as decimal marks (valid example: 100.02, not valid example : 100..02)
Parentheses
Mathematical symbols (allowed are : "+", "-", "*", "/")

Input and expected output
Input : String containing arithmetic expression
Output : evaluation result or null if the expression cannot be evaluated

2. Pyramid builder

General description
This program build a pyramid from given input list of integer values.

For example, for input A={2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1} the pyramid will look like:
[0,0,1,0,0]
[0,2,0,3,0]
[4,0,5,0,6]

Refer to unit-tests for more examples.

Input and expected output
Input : List with integer values
Output : 2D array with the pyramid or CannotBuildPyramidException if it's not possible to build one

3. Subsequence
General description
Given two sequences {X} and {Y} of arbitrary elements (java.lang.Object).

Program determine whether {X} can be built by removing some elements from {Y} without changing the order.

Input and expected output
Input : List X and List Y
Output : boolean, true if {X} can be built from {Y}, false otherwise

Examples
{X} : "A", "B", "C", "D"

{Y} : "BD", "A", "ABC", "B", "M", "D", "M","C", "DC", "D"
